# 1. Prologue
## 1.1 What happened?
1000 BC. Slave Society.  
While the slave owners were drinking wine and eating meat in the warm palace, the slaves were enduring hunger and cold, and were forced to plant crops in the vast fields.   
Unfortunately, Their hard work did not bring them warmth and prosperity, However, they received only meager sustenance. The majority of the fruits of the slaves' labor were confiscated by the slave owners to maintain their prosperous lifestyles.

In the year 1000 AD, during the feudal society, farmers emerged from their modest wooden houses constructed with planks and thatch. They toiled diligently under the relentless sun using hoes and sickles.   
Unfortunately, the land they cultivated wasn't theirs; it belonged to the feudal lords. Apart from paying rent to the landowner and substantial taxes to the government, the income from their labor barely covered their necessities for the next day's work.

In the 1800s, during the industrial society, little had changed. Workers labored over 12 hours daily in cramped, noisy, and perilous factories, earning paltry wages insufficient to afford decent shelter and basic food.   
Meanwhile, the products of their labor generated immense wealth, providing capitalists with luxurious lives.
## 1.2 What's happening?
In 2020 AD, amid a highly developed internet technology era, the situation is complex. While people engage extensively in online activities, browsing, posting, liking, commenting, sharing, chatting, shopping, gaming, and learning the content they create contributes to the vast revenues of internet giants.   
Unfortunately, despite being the original creators of these revenues, users often don't see a direct impact on their wallets. The monetization occurs through various forms like advertising, e-commerce, and paid services, leading to a disconnect between user participation and financial benefit.

Certainly, the revenue generated from user activities on the internet often doesn't directly benefit users. As of August 2023, the market values of leading internet companies illustrate the vast wealth concentrated in these corporations. 

The revenue distribution in such companies typically encompasses company expenses, investments, and shareholder returns rather than direct financial gains for the users contributing to the platform's success. Here are the market values of some prominent companies:
> * Alphabet(Google)   $1.648 Trillion
> * Amazon: 				$1.474 Trillion
> * Meta (Facebook): 		$819.32 Billion
> * Tencent: 				$379.41 Billion
> * Alibaba: 				$221.06 Billion

These figures highlight the substantial market values of these tech giants.
The average annual income figures for employees at leading internet companies in 2021 were as follows:
> * Alphabet (Google): 		$295,884
> * Meta (Facebook): 		$292,785
> * Twitter: 				$232,626
> * Microsoft: 				$176,858

These figures highlight significant variations in compensation among employees of different internet giants.
Indeed, the CEO salaries for the year 2021 were notably substantial:
> * Andy Jassy (Amazon CEO): 		$212.7 Million
> * Tim Cook (Apple CEO): 			$98.78 Million
> * Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO): 	$49.85 Million
> * Parag Agrawal (Twitter CEO): 		$30.35 Million
> * Mark Zuckerberg (Meta CEO): 		$28.82 Million

These figures underscore the considerable disparity in compensation between CEOs and ordinary employees within these companies.

It seems that the answer is clear:
The income generated by users' time spent does not find its way into their wallets; instead, it transforms into the market value of internet companies and the annual salary packages of their executives and employees.

**Is this fair?**

Certainly, compassionate individuals may argue that while internet companies consume users' time, they also offer various services such as information retrieval, news reading, and social interaction for free.  

If this makes sense, then:  
Slave owners might assert: "We provided shelter and food for our slaves."   
Feudal lords could argue: "We provide land and security for farmers."   
Similarly, factory owners might claim: "We provide jobs and income for workers." 

Nevertheless, regardless of their defenses, they cannot conceal the reality: they leveraged their advantageous positions to seize the labor income of workers, channeling it into their own interests and creating extreme unfairness.

## 1.3 What's about to happen?
Certainly, the world undergoes constant change, and unfair situations are not permanent.  
Consider this: if a worker lived in the United Kingdom in the early 18th century, their living conditions would likely be extremely challenging. However, if that same worker lived in the United States in the mid-to-late 20th century, their life could be characterized by abundance, sunshine, and joy.

**What prompted this transformation?**

In the contemporary world, where the distribution of Internet benefits is highly unbalanced, the possibility of transformation still exists. Technological progress and worker unity remain pivotal factors.   
Advances in technology can enhance efficiency and productivity, leading to an increased abundance of resources. Additionally, worker unity, through initiatives like forming trade unions, advocating for better wages and benefits, can work towards fostering a more equitable distribution of interests in society.   
The ongoing evolution of technology and collective efforts by workers may contribute to addressing the current imbalances in the distribution of Internet benefits.

Indeed, leveraging two key elements can facilitate this change.
  
First: Utilizing cutting-edge technology, specifically blockchain technology.   
The advantages of blockchain, including decentralization, immutability, transparent transactions, speed, and cost-effectiveness, can play a crucial role.  

Second: Fostering unity.   
Blockchain's "decentralization" feature has the potential to shift the global internet from the centralized Web 2.0 to the decentralized Web 3.0. This transformation allows every internet user to become an independent node within the network, holding an equal status without being tied to a specific center, as the blockchain operates without a centralized authority.
Simultaneously, its "non-tampering" and "transaction transparency" features can accurately record all users' various behaviors on the chain. Subsequently, the system can calculate the value of each user's contribution to the entire ecosystem.   
These values can serve as "proof of equity" to guide the fair distribution of network benefits to users.

Certainly, the progress of blockchain technology, while significant, cannot substitute for the crucial importance of "unity."   
The influence of each individual is limited, and major social changes typically arise only when countless individuals unite into cohesive "groups." 
History has repeatedly demonstrated the transformative power of collective action.

The above is our original intention to launch the Agates Network project.  
That's why our action slogan for this project is:  
**`Global Internet Benefit Redistribution Movement`**

# 2. Project Introduction
## 2.1 Overview
The advent of blockchain technology, marked by features such as decentralization, non-tamperability, and transparent transactions, is poised to instigate profound changes across various fields.   
Beyond being a technological upgrade, it signifies an evolution in social organizational forms, offering new possibilities for building trust, enhancing efficiency, and fostering social equity.

The Agates Network blockchain stands out as one of the most innovative, reform-minded, and exploratory projects. Functioning as a global internet benefit distribution solution, it harnesses the potential of blockchain technology.  

By leveraging the advanced features of blockchain and incorporating them into the internet product business model, the project is dedicated to constructing a decentralized, transparent, and shared ecosystem, ensuring every participant can reap its benefits.

The plan involves establishing a global decentralized node network to offer reliable technical support for all Agates Network products and services.   
Within this network, the AGAT coin serves as the fundamental unit of value, circulating freely throughout the Agates Network and undertaking essential roles in value transmission and exchange.   
This system aims to provide users with a broader spectrum of opportunities for value interaction and participation.
## 2.2 Background
In the 2020s, technological advancements and increased productivity since the end of World War II, especially in Internet and artificial intelligence technologies over the past 30 years, have propelled humanity into the AI era.   
However, despite these strides, living standards for much of the global population haven't significantly improved compared to 30 years ago.

One contributing factor to this issue lies in the monopoly position of certain leading Internet platforms.   
Capital advantages, first-mover benefits, and network effects have enabled them to swiftly amass a vast user base, establishing dominant market positions.   Through unique business models, these platforms convert users' time and energy into substantial commercial gains, absorbing a significant portion of real industry profits.   
This monopoly not only fosters unfair market competition but also exacerbates wealth concentration, widening the gap between the rich and the poor.  

We believe that blockchain technology serves as an ideal solution to these challenges. Its decentralized, transparent, and tamper-resistant characteristics provide unique advantages in addressing issues related to Internet interest monopoly and wealth differentiation.

* Indeed, blockchain is a decentralized technology where data is distributed across multiple nodes on the network, avoiding control by a single entity. This stands in stark contrast to traditional centralized Internet platforms that can form monopolies by overseeing substantial amounts of user data. The decentralized nature of blockchain helps eliminate single points of failure and discourages excessive control by individual entities, effectively disrupting monopolistic tendencies in the network.
* The technical characteristics of blockchain allow all users to access complete transaction history and data records, and have complete data control. Users’ data is stored on the blockchain, and they can choose which platforms they share it with and have the ability to revoke authorization at any time. This will help alleviate the problem of Internet platforms abusing user data and avoid the formation of data monopolies.
* Blockchain platforms utilize coins as a measure of value and a tool to motivate users. By incentivizing users to contribute to the network, a more decentralized and equitable ecosystem can be established. The active involvement of users has the potential to undermine the platform's capacity to dominate the market through imposed rules, fostering a more dynamic and participatory environment.
* Blockchain technology has the potential to foster the development of distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs), leading to the decentralization of social organizations and decision-making processes. This facilitates broader participation by users in community affairs, mitigates the concentration of power, and enhances the fairness and democratic nature of decision-making within these organizations.

The advanced features highlighted in blockchain technology have provided a clear direction for us on how to construct a decentralized, transparent, shared, and universally beneficial Agates blockchain Network.
